			<abstract>This is a digital elevation model (DEM) extracted from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) stereo images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. The original data product is a DEM from stereo images acquired at approximately 0.5 meters/pixel resolution, which allows an output DEM resolution of 1.5 to 2.0 meters/pixel using a softcopy photogrammetry system. However, in some cases, LROC DEMs were also generated at lower resolutions. The DEM was registered horizontally and vertically to LRO's Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) data. Elevation values are in meters and referred to a radius of 1737400m.</abstract>
			<purpose>The NASA Constellation Program (CxP) has identified 50 regions of interest on the Moon that the LROC NAC will image. A DEM is generated for each of these resgions using the acquired NAC images. High resolution DEMs will be essential for identifying potential landing sites, landing site hazards, placement of landed assets on the surface, as well as other surface operations and navigation needs. Site-specific DEMs will also serve as a foundation for ortho-projection and control of local/site mosaics.</purpose>
			<supplinf>The nodata value for the DEM is -3.40282266e+038</supplinf>

		<logic>For each DEM pixel, a derived confidence value is also assigned in the file named LRO_NAC_Conf_*.tif. The confidence values used to assess the DEM pixels are:
&gt;
&gt; 0 = NoDATA, outside boundary
&gt; 1 = Shadowed
&gt; 2 = Saturated
&gt; 3 = Suspicious (edge, corner, did not correlate, etc)
&gt; 4 = Interpolated/Extrapolated from neighbor pixels
&gt; 10-14 = Value range of successful correlations
&gt; 15 = Manually interpolated
&gt;
The process of DEM extraction by comparing the paired stereo images is never perfect and the resulting DEMs will contain some level of inaccuracies. The random height errors are most obvious in DEMs extracted from low signal-to-noise imagery and tend to give the surface a faceted or exaggerated rough appearance (this is particularly apparent in the shaded reliefs). Localized areas of high noise may result from shadows or other low contrast features. Errors that have more identifiable patterns, unrelated to the image quality, are artifacts of the particular extraction or editing techniques.  For example, sections of the DEM that are edited manually, though improved, may still be distinguishable by their smooth texture from the more accurately portrayed natural terrain in other areas (manual edits can also be clearly identified in the confidence maps). Linear artifacts along which the DEM height changes discontinuously by a small amount may also originate from multiple sources in the data processing. For example, such small offsets are commonly seen at the join between data from the two cameras of the LROC-NAC system. Additional rectangular artifacts can be traced to the SOCET SET Next-Generation Automatic Terrain Extraction (NGATE) matching algorithm, which divides the whole DEM into small blocks. For each block, NGATE computes a set of transformation parameters between ground XYZ and image line, sample, and X parallax. The set of parameters are computed based on the sensor model as well as the specific location. As a result, there may be some minor blocking effect (horizontal line and/or vertical line along the block boundaries). Elevation changes across both inter-camera seams and block boundaries should always be less than the expected vertical precision of 1 m. To maintain the maximum scientific integrity of the data and to preserve detail in other areas, no attempt has been made to smooth over these artifacts. To view examples of common matching issues and artifacts please see: https://pub.lmmp.nasa.gov/redmine/attachments/404/Artifacts.pdf

				<horizpar>The given horizontal accuracy is the RMS in the X (longitude) and Y (latitude) directions in meters of the final triangulation solution as reported in SOCET SET. The root mean squared (RMS) values are X=7.3m and Y=6.0m. The relative horizontal accuracy (pixel to pixel across the DEM) is the same as the spatial resolution of the DEM, which is equivalent to the post spacing (typically 1.5m).  The images used in this project were controlled to LOLA tracks that were determined to be self-consistent, but which may not have been included in a crossover solution. The total absolute error results from the combination of the DEM horizontal error and the LOLA track data horizontal error. The minimum absolute RMS accuracy of the crossover corrected LOLA data is estimated at 20m. Thus the maximum horizontal RMS for this DEM may be up to 21.3m.</horizpar>
				<qhorizpa>
					<horizpav>21.3</horizpav>
					<horizpae>21.3m represents the LOLA 20m absolute RMS accuracy root summed squared (RSS) with the maximum SOCET SET RMS of 7.3m. 1-5m relative accuracy (same as the DEM pixel spacing)</horizpae>
				</qhorizpa>
			</horizpa>
			<vertacc>
				<vertaccr>The vertical accuracy measured in SOCET SET is the RMS Z=2.9m. Since the DEM is tied to LOLA, the vertical accuracy is limited by both the absolute vertical RMS accuracy of the LOLA data and the expected vertical precision (the relative precision) of the DEM. The absolute RMS vertical accuracy of the LOLA data is expected to approach 1 meter, but at the time this DEM was created, the vertical RMS accuracy of the LOLA data is estimated at 10m. The relative precision of this DEM is expected to be 1 meter, but can be as large as 2 meters. Thus the maximum vertical RMS for this DEM may be up to 10.4m.</vertaccr>
				<qvertpa>
					<vertaccv>10.4</vertaccv>
					<vertacce>10.4m represents the LOLA 10m absolute RMS vertical accuracy root summed squared with the maximum SOCET SET RMS of 2.9m, 1-5m precision. Absolute accuracy is based on LOLA error estimates. Precision is based on SOCET SET precision and RMS error between LOLA profiles and the DEM.</vertacce>

				<procdesc>The processing approach to generate DEMs uses both the USGS digital cartographic system Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) and the commercial photogrammetric software SOCET SET (BAE Systems). ISIS provides an end-to-end system for the analysis of digital images and production of image maps. Its stereo capabilities are, however, limited. SOCET SET is tailored to aerial and Earth-orbital imagery but provides a complete workflow with modules for bundle adjustment (MST), automatic stereomatching (ATE), and interactive quality control/editing of DTMs with stereo viewing (ITE). Our processing approach for LROC stereo datasets has been to use ISIS to ingest images in an archival format, decompress them as necessary, and perform instrument-specific radiometric calibration. Software written in ISIS is used to translate the image and, more importantly, orientation parameters and other metadata, to the formats understood by SOCET SET. The commercial system is then used for "three-dimensional" processing: bundle-adjustment                            (including measurement of needed control points), DTM generation, and DTM editing. Final steps such as orthrectification and mosaicking of images can be performed either in SOCET SET or in ISIS after exporting the DTM data. Finally, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) tools were used to convert the final products to GeoTIFF.
&gt;
The shadows in the DEM were masked and images were used to fill in the shadowed areas where possible.
&gt;
        LROC Images used: M161170544LE.IMG, M161170544RE.IMG, M161177329LE.IMG, M161177329RE.IMG, M145841560LE.IMG, M145841560RE.IMG, M145848346LE.IMG, M145848346RE.IMG, M130510363LE.IMG, M130510363RE.IMG, M130517148LE.IMG, M130517148RE.IMG. The DEM from the following images is of relatively poor quality.  Therefore, these images were placed underneath the DEM generated from the images listed above and are mainly used to fill in shadow areas in the DEM resulting from M145 images: M138764852LE.IMG, M138764852RE.IMG, M138771635LE.IMG, M138771635RE.IMG.
